    The difference between the data discussed in chapter 7 and chapter 8 is that chapter 7 talks about the fundamentals of data distribution while chapter 8 builds on those concepts and shows how to display changes to the data. Chapter 7 talks about normal distributions and how to get quantities like the median, quartiles, and standard deviation. This chapter also talks about the norm which is made up of the level, spread, and shape of the data. It talks about the central tendencies related to the outliers and how to disregard the outliers to find a more accurate representation of the data. Chapter 8 builds off of the fundamentals from the previous chapter. Chapter 8 uses values like the median, quartiles, standard deviation, and the shape of the data to visualize the trend and seasonality of the data set. The trend is just evaluating the shape and seeing if the variables go up or down while evaluating the seasonality consists of looking at your data set and determining if your variables show a consistent or periodic fluctuation. This chapter also talks about finding the moving average which will compute the average of individual small chunks of data instead of the data as a whole.

    A log transformation increases by every increment of 1 to whatever your log base is. For expample, if you have a log(10) scale, each increment of one unit increases by 10 instead of just one. A pro of log transformation is that it will reduce skewness and it can convert non linear models to linear models since it is an exponential function. A con would be that if you are not careful, you will use a log transformation when it is not needed or relavent and it will mess all of your data up. Another visualization technique is moving average. Moving average allows you to look at small chunks of your data individually rather than the data as a whole. This works well when your data is overwhelmingly large do that you cannot get a good representation of the data as a whole, but if your data is relatively small, it will not work as good as if will cause you to over-examine your data. Zero based index is just the idea of starting arrays off with zero instead of one. A pro to this is that once your framework understands the zero based index, it is a lot easier than starting at one. A con would be that if your framework does not fully adhere to the zero based functions, it will get tricky to make sure you put in the right code every time.
